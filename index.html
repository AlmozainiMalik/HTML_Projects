    <p>
        My name is <i><b>Yoshikage Kira</b></i>. I’m <strong>33 years old</strong>. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. 
        I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. 
        I don’t smoke, but I occasionally drink. I’m in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. 
        After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. 
        Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning.
